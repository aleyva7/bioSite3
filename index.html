          <!--STRONG TO EMPHASIZE SHE HAS MANY GOALS-->
        <td><strong>Ashley has many goals in life.</strong> One in particular is going to Japan. Ashley had almost accomplished this goal back in 2020 for her honeymoon after her wedding, however, COVID happened and restricted all flights into Japan. She still hopes to make it there one day, sooner rather than later.</td>
        <td>Another goal Ashley has is becoming an optometrist. After college, Ashley fell into the vision portion of the healthcare umbrella. She finds eyes to be fascinating and wishes to be a doctor of the eyes. She has had multiple jobs working in the ophthalmology field and has even been the person to create the lens portion of the eye glasses. She hopes to begin towards this goal here shortly. </td>

        <tr>
         
        <td>An accomplishment that Ashley has made is getting married. This may seem like a silly "accomplishment" to some but to Ashley it meant the world to her to get married. She had always looked forward to getting married one day and she married her best friend. She is proud to call herself a wife and they are going on 5 years strong.</td>
        <td>Another accomplishment that Ashley has made is starting her own business. She's very humble in the sense that she will correct you and tell you that it is just a "shop". However, she has a hobby of creating trinkets based on anime shows and cartoons and selling them. She even had her own booth set up at a local comic con in her city. She takes pride in the trinkets she makes and is always working on adding more to the shop. </td>
