      <p>Ashley was born in August of 1994. She is an older sister to a younger brother and a wife. She places importance on her marriage as she sees it as one of her biggest accomplishments. Her and her lovely husband live in South Carolina and have three wonderful fur babies of which are two dogs and a cat. Ashley attended the University of South Carolina Upstate where she studied Psychology. Ashley currently works as a technician at an eyeglasses company where she handles the prescriptions of glasses for clients. She hopes to go back to school to become an optometrist. She is fascinated with the human eye and hopes to learn more than what she already knows.</p>

      <p>She lives a simple and basic life and is happy with it. She does not need some extravagant type of life. She comes from a small town and currently lives in a slightly bigger town. She enjoys the country setting rather than the busy city life. Where she lives, she is able to star-gaze and loves that she can see the night sky without all the light pollution. Ashley is a big homebody and enjoys watching movies and tv shows with her husband when he is not away from home with work assignments. She enjoys going to comic conventions and her husband will proudly be at her side cosplaying, or being dressed up, with her. Ashley likes to stay busy and has many hobbies.
